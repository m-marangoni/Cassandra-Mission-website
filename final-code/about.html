				This project is an exploration about the ethics underlying post-human legacy. There are companies
				already thinking about new forms of archives that can withstand for billions of years in space, but the
				narratives those individuals are choosing to keep is far from ideal. Again, History repeats itself as
				only the narratives of the few powerful may have a chance to survive our extinction and find other
				civilizations with potential curiosity for interplanetary archaelogy.
				Maybe there is no perfectly ethical way to store all human and non-human memory respectfully in all its
				complexity. I believe such a quest is impossible, so what I am rather proposing here is a reflection on
				human urges to tell stories about ourselves and avoid the prospect of death. Perhaps it doesn’t matter
				how those spatial ‘time-capsules’ are going to be curated and by whom, but what this desire to
				desperately clutter the Solar System with our footprints can tell about the moment we are living now.
				By accepting the forgetfulness as not something to be feared, we can celebrate what we have now, while
				we can still make a difference to all coexisting lives.
